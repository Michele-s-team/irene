'''
Boundary geometry for finite-element computations.

This module deals with geometric quantities defined on manifold boundaries:
 it provides boundary normals and tangents both as
UFL-level objects and as smooth (CG2) field representations that can be
plotted.

  - FacetTangent: unit boundary tangent of a 2D mesh, obtained by rotating
    FacetNormal by pi/2.
  - facet_normal_sub_meshes, facet_tangent_sub_meshes: build boundary
    normals/tangents for each sub-mesh of a parent mesh.
  - field_facet_normal: project a facet normal onto a smooth CG2 field
    (non-normalized), over a boundary (ds) or interior-facet (dS) measure.
  - field_facet_normal_normalized, field_facet_tangent_normalized: smooth,
    Euclidean-normalized boundary normal and tangent fields
  - calc_tangent_cg2: smooth (non-normalized) boundary tangent field.
 
On import, the module also constructs module-level facet_normal,
facet_tangent, and their sub-mesh counterparts for the mesh(es) loaded in
mesh.load, handling both the single-mesh and multi-mesh cases.
