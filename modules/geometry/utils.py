'''
check whether a point lies on the line between two other points
Input values: 
    * Mandatory:
        - 'p': the point [p_x, p_y, p_z]
        - 'a', 'b': the two points defining the line [a_x, a_y, a_z], [b_x, b_y, b_z]
    * Optional: 
        - 'epsilon': the tolerance to check that p sits on the infinite line that goes through a and b
        
Return values: 
    - True if the  points lies on the line, False otherwise

check whether a point is in the region delimited by a polygon
Input values: 
    - 'x': [X, Y] the coordinates of the point

Return values:
